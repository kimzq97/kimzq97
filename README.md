- 👋 Hi, I’m @kimzq97. I come from a media and international business background currently working at a tech startup in California.
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring front end development and I'm looking to use github to showcase the stuff I get up to!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to balance my FT job while finishing my masters and learning how to code 
- 💞️ I love a good hardcoverd book, kicking ass on the switch, and basketball #WeTheNorth
